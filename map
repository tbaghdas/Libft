each project in the 42 common core contains an encoded hint. for each
circle, only one project provides the correct hint needed for the
next circle. this challenge is individual, with a final prize for
one student. staff members may participate but are not eligible for a
prize. are you among the very first to solve a circle? send the hints
with explanations to ol@42.fr to be added to the leaderboard. the
hint for this first project, which may contain anagrammed words, is:
